# GEARS 

<!-- @Prompt -->
I was attempting to build it in a manner I thought would look fantastic on a resume. 

<!-- @Prompt -->
Other than Scribbles and Ink, of which are code bases I am not proud of, and the current version of Gears, which is a code base that I am not proud of, I have very little to show for this 11 years of experience that I allegedly have. One of my packages on GitHub has 150 stars, that’s about it.

<!-- @Prompt -->
I really wanted to leave you with something that works for you, because I know what your needs are, and I have a fantastic model for how this software should work, which I am going to share with you along with obviously everything that I have written. But also, the fact that I had built software that an animation company was currently using to run their pipeline? That’s going to look fantastic on a resume. Also, the possibility of it being an enterprise piece of software? I’m highly incentivized.

<!-- @Prompt -->
But, if it is going to be an enterprise level piece of software, the code can’t be public, so I can’t use it for a resume. However, if the public dependencies that it DOES use are all written by me, then that’s all my bases covered. 

<!-- @Prompt -->
And when I say public dependencies, I mean for things like data validation, or a file server, or queuing asynchronous tasks, or rendering, or structuring server commands. Stuff that isn’t business sensitive, the kind of stuff you use public modules for. Just in case Gears is only ever used at Global Mechanic, I need stuff that will demonstrate my efficacy as a developer, because you wont need me very much. I’m sure there will be feature changes over time, change this, bug here, feature there, etc, but it won’t be a full time job, I’ll need to work elsewhere. Also, if I’m the author of all of it’s dependencies, then they’ll be maintained as well. And I can use them for other projects, such as run and gun, or my own website. 

<!-- @Prompt -->
I have extensive details of how all these public modules work, they’re not well documented, but I have presentations about many of them and plans for more. I’ve linked these public dependencies in my resume, but no job interviewer is going to sit there and read your code, they need an article or documentation, so I’ve been making them. 

<!-- @Prompt -->
However, for one of my public modules: a data validation library that I’m proud of that demonstrates I know the type system extremely well and it’s extremely good for defining database models, etcetera. I had prepared a presentation about this library for an interview and they wouldn’t look at it. And then they proceeded to ask me a bunch of questions I didn’t have answers to. I’ve had quite a few interviews in the passed four months and of course I have fantastic answers for the problems that I have solved, I’ve had many questions without any answer a tall. For example, how I would manage a database with hundreds of millions of rows. The same way I’d manage a database with 100 thousand rows is apparently not a good answer. 

<!-- @Prompt -->

Point is, after 5 or 6 failed interviews I have to re-address my approach, and accept the reality that perhaps if 5 different companies don’t consider me a senior developer, then perhaps I don’t have the experience of a senior developer, and do some skills development while going for intermediate level positions. The fact that these public modules aren’t complete doesn’t help either. I am not NEARLY the hot shit that I thought was. The research that I have conducted in the last couple of months to fill these holes in my skill-set has led to changes in the model I had in mind for gears. I’ll detail the differences during this presentation.
